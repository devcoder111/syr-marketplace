        # SYR – Terms of Service
        ## 1. Contractual Relationship.
        These Terms of Service (“Terms”) are a binding legal agreement between you and SYR that
        govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from SYR (collectively, the
        “SYR Platform”). By accessing and using the websites, applications, and other offerings from
        SYR, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this
        Agreement. We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these
        Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, we will post the changes on this page and will indicate
        at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised. We will also notify you, either through
        the Services user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means. Any such
        changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that
        changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be
        effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become
        effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. If you do not agree to abide by
        these or any future Terms of Service, do not use or access (or continue to use or access) the Service.

        PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY CONTAIN AN
        AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE AND OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION REGARDING
        YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS, REMEDIES, AND OBLIGATIONS. THE AGREEMENT TO
        ARBITRATE REQUIRES (WITH LIMITED EXCEPTION) THAT YOU SUBMIT CLAIMS
        YOU HAVE AGAINST US TO BINDING AND FINAL ARBITRATION, AND FURTHER (1)
        YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED TO PURSUE CLAIMS AGAINST SYR ON AN
        INDIVIDUAL BASIS, NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR
        REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING, (2) YOU WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED
        TO SEEK RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY
        RELIEF) ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND (3) YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HAVE ANY
        CLAIMS YOU HAVE AGAINST US RESOLVED BY A JURY OR IN A COURT OF LAW.

        Supplemental terms may apply to certain options or offers available through the Services, such as
        policies for a particular ride or logistics option, event, program, activity, or promotion. Such
        supplemental terms will be disclosed to you in connection with the applicable option or offer.
        Supplemental terms are in addition to, and shall be deemed a part of, the Terms for the purposes
        of the applicable option or offer. Supplemental terms shall prevail over these Terms in the event
        of a conflict with respect to the applicable option or offer.
        SYR may make changes to these Terms from time to time. If SYR makes changes, it will provide
        you with notice of such changes, such as by sending an email, providing a notice through the
        Services, or updating the date at the top of these Terms. Unless SYR says otherwise in its notice,
        the amended Terms will be effective immediately and your continued access to and use of the
        Services after SYR provides such notice will confirm your acceptance of the changes. If you do
        not agree to the amended Terms, you must stop accessing and using the Services.

        If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a business or other legal entity, you represent
        that you have the authority to bind such entity to this Agreement, in which case the terms "User",
        "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. When used in these Terms, “SYR,” “we,” “us,” or “our”
        refers to the SYR entity with whom you are contracting. If you do not have such authority, or if
        you do not agree with the terms of this Agreement, you must not accept this Agreement and may
        not access and use the Website and Services. You acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract
        between you and SYR, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by you, and it
        governs your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from SYR.
        In addition, when using certain services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to
        such services that may be posted on the Service from time to time, including, without limitation,
        the Privacy Policy located at https://beta.syr.market/privacy/. All such terms are hereby
        incorporated by reference into these Terms of Service.
        ## 2. Arbitration Agreement.
        By agreeing to the Terms, you agree that you are required to resolve any claim that you may have
        against SYR on an individual basis in arbitration as set forth in this Arbitration Agreement. This
        will preclude you from bringing any class, collective, or representative action against SYR, and
        also preclude you from participating in or recovering relief under any current or future class,
        collective, consolidated, or representative action brought against SYR by someone else. For the
        avoidance of doubt, this precludes you from bringing or participating in any kind of any class,
        collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint
        action against SYR.
        ### (a) Agreement to Binding Arbitration Between You and SYR.
        Except as expressly provided below in Section 2(b), you and SYR agree that any dispute, claim or
        controversy in any way arising out of or relating to (i) these Terms and prior versions of these
        Terms, or the existence, breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity
        thereof, (ii) your access to or use of the Services at any time, (iii) incidents or accidents resulting
        in personal injury that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether
        the dispute, claim or controversy occurred or accrued before or after the date you agreed to the
        Terms, or (iv) your relationship with SYR, will be settled by binding arbitration between you and
        SYR, and not in a court of law. This Agreement survives after your relationship with SYR ends.
        You acknowledge and agree that you and SYR are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to
        bring or to participate as a plaintiff or class member in any class, purported class, collective,
        coordinated, consolidated, or representative proceeding.
        This Arbitration Agreement shall be binding upon and shall include any claims brought by or
        against any third-parties, including but not limited to your spouses, heirs, third-party beneficiaries
        and assigns, where their underlying claims are in relation to your use of the Services. To the extent
        that any third-party beneficiary to this agreement brings claims against the Parties; those claims
        shall also be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.
        ### (b) Exceptions to Arbitration.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Arbitration Agreement shall not require arbitration of the
        following claims (i) individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter remains
        in such court and advances only on an individual (non-class, non-representative) basis; (ii)
        individual claims of sexual assault or sexual harassment occurring in connection with your use of
        the Services; and/or (iii) injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
        prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights,
        trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights.
        Such claims may be brought and litigated in a court of competent jurisdiction by you on an
        individual basis only. On an individual basis means that you cannot bring such claims as a class,
        coordinated, consolidated, collective, or representative action against SYR. For the avoidance of
        doubt, this precludes you from bringing claims as or participating in any kind of any class,
        collective, coordinated, consolidated, representative or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint
        action against SYR and no action brought by you may be consolidated or joined in any fashion
        with any other proceeding. Where your claims are brought and litigated to completion on such an
        individual basis in a court of competent jurisdiction, SYR agrees to honor your election.
        The parties’ agreement not to require arbitration in these limited instances does not waive the
        enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited
        to, the waivers provided for in Section 2(a), which will continue to apply in court as well as in
        arbitration), or the enforceability of this Agreement as to any other controversy, claim or dispute.
        ### (c) Rules and Governing Law.
        The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") in
        accordance with the AAA’s Consumer Arbitration Rules (the "AAA Rules") then in effect, except
        as modified by this Arbitration Agreement. The AAA Rules are available at www.adr.org or by
        calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879.
        The parties agree that the arbitrator ("Arbitrator"), and not any federal, state, or local court or
        agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any disputes relating to the interpretation,
        applicability, enforceability or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including any claim that
        all or any part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable. The Arbitrator shall also be
        responsible for determining all threshold arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether
        the Terms are applicable, unconscionable or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including
        waiver, delay, laches, or estoppel. If there is a dispute about whether this Arbitration Agreement
        can be enforced or applies to a dispute, you and SYR agree that the arbitrator will decide that issue.
        Notwithstanding any choice of law or other provision in the Terms, the parties agree and
        acknowledge that this Arbitration Agreement evidences a transaction involving interstate
        commerce and that the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq. ("FAA"), will govern its
        interpretation and enforcement and proceedings pursuant thereto. It is the intent of the parties to
        be bound by the provisions of the FAA for all purposes, including, but not limited to, interpretation,
        implementation, enforcement, and administration of this Arbitration Agreement, and that the FAA 
        and AAA Rules shall preempt all state laws to the fullest extent permitted by law. If the FAA and
        AAA Rules are found to not apply to any issue regarding the interpretation or enforcement of this
        Arbitration Agreement, then that issue shall be resolved under the laws of the state where you
        reside when you accept these Terms.
        Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to incidents or accidents resulting in
        personal injury (including but not limited to sexual assault or harassment claims) that you allege
        occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether before or after the date you agreed
        to the Terms, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which
        the incident or accident occurred.
        ### (d) Process.
        Pre-Arbitration Dispute Resolution and Notification. Prior to initiating an arbitration, you and SYR
        each agree to notify the other party in writing of any dispute and to attempt to negotiate an informal
        resolution. Notice of the dispute must include the party’s name, preferred contact information, a
        brief description of the dispute, and the relief sought. Notice to SYR must be sent. Neither party
        shall initiate arbitration until 30 days after the notice is sent. Engaging in this pre-arbitration
        dispute resolution and notification process is a requirement that must be fulfilled before
        commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing fee deadlines shall be tolled while
        the parties engage in the informal resolution process required by this paragraph.
        Initiating Arbitration. In order to initiate arbitration, a party must provide the other party with a
        written Demand for Arbitration and file the Demand with AAA as specified in the AAA Rules.
        (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration - Consumer Arbitration Rules
        at www.adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879). A party initiating an arbitration against
        SYR must send the written Demand for Arbitration to SYR. The Arbitrator will be either (1) a
        retired judge or (2) an attorney licensed to practice law in the state where the arbitration is
        conducted. The Arbitrator will be selected by the parties from the AAA's National Roster of
        Arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree upon an Arbitrator after a good faith meet and confer
        effort, then the AAA will appoint the Arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.
        ### (e) Location and Procedure.
        Unless you and SYR otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where you
        reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely on the
        basis of documents you and SYR submit to the Arbitrator, unless you request a hearing or the
        Arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right to a
        hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the Arbitrator will have
        the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
        expedited nature of the arbitration.
        ### (f) Arbitrator's Decision.
        The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. Judgment
        on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction to do so. The
        Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant and only to the 
        extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant's individual claim. An Arbitrator’s
        decision shall be final and binding on all parties. An Arbitrator’s decision and judgment thereon
        shall have no precedential or collateral estoppel effect. If you prevail in arbitration you may seek
        an award of attorneys' fees and expenses to the extent permitted under applicable law. SYR will
        not seek, and hereby waives all rights SYR may have under applicable law to recover attorneys'
        fees and expenses if SYR prevails in arbitration.
        ### (g) Fees.
        Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set
        forth in the AAA Rules.
        ### (h) Severability and Survival.
        If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any
        reason, (1) the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from these Terms; (2)
        severance of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the
        remainder of the Arbitration Agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any
        remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement; and (3) to the
        extent that any claims must therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or representative
        basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration,
        and the parties agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the outcome of any
        individual claims in arbitration.
        ## 3. The Marketplace Platform & Services.
        SYR operates a multi-dimensional digital marketplace platform that is offered in a number of
        forms, including mobile and/or web based applications (“Applications”). Among other things, the
        SYR Marketplace Platform enables you to receive (i) services rendered by SYR that facilitate
        your connection to independent third-party providers, including drivers, Home-Chefs, third-party
        apps, and restaurants (“Third-party Providers”), for the purchase of services or goods, such as
        transportation, logistics and/or delivery services from those Third-party Providers; and (ii) any
        related content or services, including payment processing and customer support. The SYR
        Marketplace Platform and the SYR content or services described in this Section are collectively
        referred to as “the Services”. Unless otherwise agreed by SYR in a separate written agreement
        with you, the Services are made available solely for your personal, noncommercial use.

        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ABILITY TO OBTAIN FOOD, DINING,
        ENTERTAINMENT, LOGISTICS AND/OR DELIVERY SERVICES FROM THIRD-PARTY
        PROVIDERS THROUGH THE USE OF THE SYR MARKETPLACE PLATFORM AND
        SERVICES DOES NOT ESTABLISH SYR AS A PROVIDER OF FOOD, DINING,
        ENTERTAINMENT, TRANSPORTATION, LOGISTICS OR DELIVERY SERVICES OR AS
        A TRANSPORTATION OR PROPERTY CARRIER. SYR IS NOT A COMMON OR MOTOR
        CARRIER, DOES NOT TRANSPORT YOU, AND USE OF THE SYR MARKETPLACE
        PLATFORM IS ONLY OPEN TO REGISTERED USERS OF THE SYR MARKETPLACE
        PLATFORM AND NOT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC.
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, INCLUDING
        DRIVERS ARE NOT ACTUAL AGENTS, APPARENT AGENTS, OSTENSIBLE AGENTS,
        OR EMPLOYEES OF SYR IN ANY WAY.
        YOU ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ANY SAFETY RELATED EFFORT, FEATURE,
        PROCESS, POLICY, STANDARD OR OTHER EFFORT UNDERTAKEN BY SYR, IN THE
        INTEREST OF PUBLIC SAFETY (WHETHER REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
        REGULATIONS OR NOT), IS NOT AN INDICIA OF AN EMPLOYMENT, ACTUAL
        AGENCY, APPARENT AGENCY, OR OSTENSIBLE AGENCY RELATIONSHIP WITH AN
        INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY HOME-CHEF OR DRIVER.
        ### (a) License.
        Subject to your compliance with these Terms, SYR grants you a limited, non-exclusive, nonsublicensable, revocable, 
        non-transferable license to (i) access and use the Applications on your
        personal device solely in connection with your use of the Services; and (ii) access and use any
        content, information and related materials that may be made available through the Services, in
        each case solely for your personal, noncommercial use. Any rights not expressly granted herein
        are reserved by SYR and SYR's licensors.
        ### (b) Restrictions.
        You may not (i) remove any copyright, trademark or other proprietary notices from any portion
        of the Services; (ii) reproduce, modify, prepare derivative works based upon, distribute, license,
        lease, sell, resell, transfer, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, stream, broadcast or
        otherwise exploit the Services except as expressly permitted by SYR; (iii) decompile, reverse
        engineer or disassemble the Services except as may be permitted by applicable law; (iv) link to,
        mirror or frame any portion of the Services; (v) cause or launch any programs or scripts for the
        purpose of unduly burdening or hindering the operation and/or functionality of any aspect of the
        Services; or (vi) attempt to gain unauthorized access to or impair any aspect of the Services or its
        related systems or networks.
        ### (c) Third-party Services and Content.
        The Services may be made available or accessed in connection with third-party services and
        content (including advertising) that SYR does not control. Once you click on a link to third-party
        services or content, you will be subject to the terms and conditions and privacy policy of that
        website, destination, or third-party service provider. SYR will not warn you that you have left the
        Services or that you are subject to the terms and conditions (including privacy policies) of another
        website, destination, or third-party service provider. You use all links in third-party websites and
        advertisements at your own risk as these are not part of the Services and are not controlled by
        SYR. You acknowledge that different terms of use and privacy policies may apply to your use of
        such third-party services and content. SYR does not endorse such third-party services and content
        and in no event shall SYR be responsible or liable for any products or services of such third-party
        providers.
        ### (d) App Stores.
        You acknowledge and agree that the availability of the Applications may be dependent on the
        third-party from which you received the Application’s license, e.g., the Apple iPhone or Android
        app stores (“App Store”). You acknowledge and agree that this Agreement is between you and
        SYR and not with the App Store and that SYR is responsible for the provision of Services as
        described in this Agreement. However, if you downloaded the Application from the Apple App
        Store, Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this Agreement. Upon your
        acceptance of this Agreement, Apple shall have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the
        right) to enforce this Agreement against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof. This Agreement
        incorporates by reference Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement, for
        purposes of which, you are “the end-user.” In the event of a conflict in the terms of the Licensed
        Application End User License Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of this Agreement will
        control.
        ### (e) Ownership.
        The Services and all rights therein are and shall remain SYR's property or the property of SYR's
        licensors. Neither these Terms nor your use of the Services convey or grant to you any rights in or
        related to the Services except for the limited license granted above.
        You agree that you will not use SYR’s trademarks, service marks, or trade dress or any similar
        names, marks, or trade dress (“SYR’s Marks”), aside from use incidental to your use of the
        Services, without express, written permission from SYR. This prohibition on using SYR’s Marks
        includes, but is not limited to, use in domain names, websites, and social media accounts.
        ### (f) Intellectual Property Rights.
        "Intellectual Property Rights" means all present and future rights conferred by statute, common
        law or equity in or in relation to any copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents,
        inventions, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to inventions, rights to use, and all
        other intellectual property rights, in each case whether registered or unregistered and including all
        applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim priority from, such rights and
        all similar or equivalent rights or forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity
        which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the world. This Agreement does
        not transfer to you any intellectual property owned by SYR or third parties, and all rights, titles,
        and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the parties) solely with SYR. All
        trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection with the Website and Services,
        are trademarks or registered trademarks of SYR or its licensors. Other trademarks, service marks,
        graphics and logos used in connection with the Website and Services may be the trademarks of
        other third parties. Your use of the Website and Services grants you no right or license to reproduce
        or otherwise use any of SYR or third-party trademarks.
        ## 4. Access and Use of the Services.

        The SYR Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search
        for, and book events and services. Members who publish and offer services are “Hosts” and 
        Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Hosts offer accommodations
        (“Accommodations”), kitchens (“Kitchens”), activities, excursions, and events (“Experiences”),
        and a variety of cooking, travel, and other services (collectively, “Host Services,” and each Host
        Service offering, a “Listing”). SYR also offers a marketplace in which personal Home-Chefs,
        caterers and other individuals list, offer, sell and deliver food items and meal orders (“Meal(s)”)
        to the general public, and customers browse and purchase Meals. Users who purchase Meals
        through the Service are "Customer(s)," and users who list, prepare and sell Meals through the
        Service are "Home-Chef(s)." A user may be both a Customer and Home-Chef. All purchases are
        made directly (and any contract for purchase and sale is) between the Customer and Home-Chef.
        The Service includes pricing assistance and delivery, but we are not a party to any purchase or
        sales transaction. We may also help facilitate the resolution of disputes between our Customers
        and Home-Chefs, but SYR has no control over and does not guarantee (a) the existence, quality,
        safety, authenticity, or legality of Meals offered or sold on the Service; (b) the truth or accuracy of
        a Home-Chef's content or listings on the Service; (c) the ability of a Home-Chef to sell Meals
        through the Service and deliver Meals within required delivery windows; (d) the ability of
        Customers to pay for Meals purchased through the Service; or (e) that a Customer or Home-Chef
        will actually complete a transaction, effectuate trouble-free delivery and shipping, or return a Meal
        through the Service.

        Each Home-Chef is solely responsible for complying with all applicable laws, rules and
        regulations and standards, including but not limited to those pertaining to the preparation, sale,
        marketing, and packaging of all Meals ordered through SYR, and updating details and prices
        relating to the Meals offered. Each Home-Chef is solely liable for the quality, safety, and freshness
        of its products, and SYR does not verify the credentials, representations, products, services or
        prices offered by any Home-Chefs, and does not guarantee the quality of the product or services,
        or that Home-Chefs or Meals comply with applicable laws. SYR will not be liable or responsible
        for any Meals provided by Home-Chefs that are a cause of injury or that do not meet your
        expectations in any manner.

        SYR may enter into agreements with independent contractors (each a “Courier”) to provide
        delivery services under certain circumstances if desirable by individual Home-Chefs. If a HomeChef chooses to use a Courier to deliver a Meal, SYR is not offering such delivery services and
        has no responsibility or liability for the actions or inactions of any Courier. SYR will not be liable
        or responsible for any delivery services provided by a Courier or any errors or misrepresentations
        made by them. Couriers are required to comply with all applicable laws, rules, and regulations.
        You must register an account to access and use many features of the SYR Platform and must keep
        your account information accurate. As the provider of the SYR Platform, SYR does not own,
        control, offer or manage any Listings or Host Services. SYR is not a party to the contracts
        concluded directly between Hosts and Guests, nor is SYR a delivery, food distribution, real estate
        broker or insurer. SYR is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified
        in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). 

        We maintain other terms and policies that supplement these Terms like our Privacy Policy, which
        describes our collection and use of personal data, and our Payments Terms, which govern any
        payment services provided to Members by the SYR payment entities ("SYR Payments").
        If you Host, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations,
        and contracts with third parties that apply to your Host Services.

        Account, and you agree to always maintain the security and secrecy of your Account username
        and password. Unless otherwise permitted by SYR in writing, you may only possess one Account.

        kind incurred as a result of such acts or omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account
        (or any part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of this Agreement or
        that your conduct or content would tend to damage our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your

        ## (b) Home-Chef Accounts and Services.
        ## i. Marketplace Risk.
        SYR is not affiliated with or endorsed by any Home-Chef, restaurant or other meal preparation
        service made available through the Service. Beyond its capacity as a marketplace and technology
        platform, SYR is not involved in any transaction between Customers and Home-Chefs, and does
        not act as a Customer, Home-Chef (or affiliate for a Customer or Home-Chef) or broker with
        respect to any transactions. There are risks that you assume when dealing with other users
        (including those who may be acting under false pretenses) and all of these risks are borne by you,
        and not SYR. We encourage you to use the various functionalities of the Service (e.g., Home-Chef
        profiles, meal options, and user reviews) to help evaluate the user with whom you are dealing.
        ## ii. Home-Chefs as Independent Contractors.
        Users of the Service acting in the capacity of a Home-Chef do so in their personal capacity as an
        independent contractor and not as an employee of SYR. As a Home-Chef, you agree that (i) you
        will accept any directions issued by SYR pertaining to the goals to be attained and the results to
        be achieved by Home-Chefs generally, but you shall be solely responsible for the manner and
        hours in which your services are performed; (ii) you are responsible for and will comply with all
        applicable laws and registration requirements, including those applicable to independent
        contractors and maximum working hours regulations; (iii) these Terms of Service do not create an
        association, joint venture, partnership, franchise, or employer/employee relationship between you
        and SYR, or you and a Customer; (iv) you will not represent yourself as an employee or agent of
        SYR or any Customer; (v) you will not be entitled to any of the benefits that a SYR may make
        available to its employees, such as vacation pay, sick leave, and insurance programs, including
        group health insurance or retirement benefits; and (vi) you are not eligible to recover contributor's
        compensation benefits in the event of injury. As a Home-Chef, you will not engage a Customer in
        any way that may jeopardize your status as an independent contractor.
        ## iii. Home-Chef Restrictions.
        In addition to the foregoing conduct restrictions, to the extent you are a Home-Chef, you represent
        and warrant that your use of the Services to market, advertise and sell Meals does not violate any
        applicable law or regulation, including but not limited to the California Retail Food Code
        (excerpted from the California Health and Safety Code). As a Home-Chef located in California,
        you represent and warrant that you prepare and provide all Meals to Customers using a qualified

        defined in Section 113825 of the California Retail Food Code, as amended), you further represent
        and warrant that you are in compliance with the terms of Chapter 11.6 of the California Retail
        Food Code, as amended, which requires, among other things, that

        that include the following information (i) all food types or products that will be handled,
        (ii) the proposed procedures and methods for food preparation and handling, (iii)
        procedures, methods, and schedules for cleaning utensils, equipment, and for the disposal
        of refuse; (iv) how food will be maintained at the required holding temperatures, pending
        pickup by Customers or during delivery; and (v) days and times that the home kitchen will
        potentially be utilized as a microenterprise home kitchen operation;
        3. You have successfully (i) passed an approved and accredited food safety certification
        examination, (ii) passed an inspection and (iii) received a permit to operate issued from the
        local enforcement agency;

        enforcement agency remains valid and in full effect;
        5. Any person delivering Meals on behalf of your permitted microenterprise home kitchen
        operation is an employee or a family/household member of yours, and if such a person
        drives a motor vehicle to deliver Meals, the person has a valid driver's license;
        6. You have entered (and updated when necessary) the permit number for your
        microenterprise home kitchen operation in the dedicated field provided by us during the
        sign-up process;
        7. You have no more than one full-time equivalent food employee, not including a family
        member or household member;
        8. Your Meals are prepared, cooked and served to Customers on the same day;
        9. Your Meals are consumed either (i) onsite at your microenterprise home kitchen or (ii)
        offsite if the food is picked up by the consumer or delivered within a safe time period;
        10. Your Meal preparation does not involve processes that require or handle raw milk or
        require a HACCP plan;
        11. Your Meals do not include raw oysters;
        12. You do not prepare more than 30 individual Meals per day, and no more than 60 Meals per
        week (or the approximate equivalents of each if meal components are sold separately);
        13. Your operation has no more than fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in verifiable gross annual
        sales, as adjusted annually for inflation based on the California Consumer Price Index; and

        For further information on California's regulations regarding microenterprise home
        kitchens, please review the resources provided by the Cook Alliance at
        www.cookalliance.org. SYR does not support the accuracy of information or endorse any
        opinions contained on the Cook Alliance website.
        ## iv. Ingredients and Allergens
        For any particular Meal and related content posted using the Service, a Home-Chef shall provide
        a comprehensive list of ingredients contained in or otherwise used to prepare the Meal, including
        any known allergens. SYR is not responsible for the accuracy of the information and labeling of
        Meals delivered to Customer. Customers should be advised that Meals may be prepared in facilities
        using the same equipment that is used to prepare Meals containing other allergens even if the
        allergen is marked as being absent from the food. SYR shall not be liable for any illness, health
        problem, or other damages that may result from any order or consumption of any Meals and related
        items purchased through the Service.
        ## v. Home-Chef Insurance
        SYR does not maintain insurance for liabilities that may arise from your use of the Service as
        either a Customer or Home-Chef. If you are a Home-Chef, SYR recommends that you obtain
        appropriate insurance to cover the operation of your food facility and the preparation and delivery
        of Meals. Please review any respective insurance policy carefully, and in particular make sure that
        you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for,
        such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will
        cover the actions or inactions of Customers or any third-party service.

        You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you
        receive ("Charges"). SYR will enable your payment of the applicable Charges for services or
        goods obtained through your use of the Services. Charges will include applicable taxes where
        required by law. Charges may include other applicable fees, product return fees, cancellation fees,
        estimated or actual tolls, and/or surcharges. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges
        applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand
        or due to other marketplace factors.

        ### (a) Fees.
        Registering for the Service is free; however, SYR charges certain fees for various transactions
        effected through the Service, as set forth in the fee policy located at https://SYR.com/feepolicy (the “Fee Policy”). Unless otherwise stated, all fees are quoted in U.S. dollars.

        ### (b) Taxes; Shipping Costs; Customer Responsibility.
        Meals purchased by and delivered to Customers in locations in the U.S. may be subject to
        applicable state or local sales or use tax, privilege tax or similar transaction-based taxes required
        in the food services industry of a particular location ("Taxes"). The amount of Taxes is based on
        a number of factors, including but not limited to a Customer's designated delivery address, and/or
        the location of the Home-Chef.
        Customers are responsible for paying to a Home-Chef the applicable purchase price for a
        purchased Meal, as well as any delivery costs and paying applicable Taxes associated with the
        purchase and sale of any Meals through the Service. Delivery costs and Taxes attributable to the
        sale of any Meals are not included in the listed price for any Meals listed by Home-Chefs through
        the Service but will be displayed to Customers before confirmation of any purchase.
        Home-Chefs are responsible for paying SYR's commission set forth in the Fee Policy as well as
        their own taxes imposed or measured by such Home-Chef's net income, net profits, income, profits,
        and/or revenues associated with the sale of any Meals through the Service.

        ### (c) Packaging.
        Home-Chefs may choose to purchase packaging materials and/or labels from us for the delivery
        of Meals prepared for Customers. If purchased, we may charge your credit card or other acceptable
        payment method you provide.

        ### (d) Payments; Subscriptions.
        Customers may pay for Items using credit cards or other payment methods as may be determined
        by SYR from time to time. Home-Chefs will be prompted to provide bank account details to us so
        that we may facilitate transfer of payments received from Customers purchasing Meals. If you
        submit your payment information through the Service, then you authorize SYR to store that
        payment information and charge your payment method for any Item you purchase. You will
        promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing
        address or credit card expiration date) that may occur.
        If you purchase Meals on a recurring or subscription basis, you hereby authorize SYR to bill your
        payment instrument in advance on a periodic basis in accordance with the terms of any particular
        subscription order until you terminate or pause such order or terminate your account, and you
        further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let SYR know
        within fourteen (14) days after the date that SYR charges you.
        All Charges and payments will be enabled by SYR using the preferred payment method designated
        in your Account, after which you will receive a receipt. If your primary Account payment method
        is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that SYR may
        use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available. Charges paid by you are final and
        non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by SYR.

        ### (e) Fee Modifications; Promotions; Credits.
        As between you and SYR, SYR reserves the right to establish or adjust Charges for any or all
        services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time. SYR will use reasonable
        efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges
        incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof.
        Certain users may from time to time receive promotional offers and discounts that may result in
        different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of
        the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available
        to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you.
        Promotional offers and discounts are subject to change or withdrawal at any time and without
        notice. You may elect to cancel your request for Services at any time prior to the commencement
        of such Services, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a Third-Party Provider’s
        behalf.

        ### (f) Third-Party Providers.
        With respect to Third Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third Party
        Providers, and SYR will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third-Party Provider’s 
        behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be considered
        the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. In such cases, you retain
        the right to request lower Charges from a Third-Party Provider for services or goods received by
        you from such Third-Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods, and Charges
        you incur will be owed to the Third-Party Provider. SYR will consider in good faith any request
        from a Third-Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good. This payment
        structure is intended to fully compensate a Third-Party Provider, if applicable, for the services or
        goods obtained in connection with your use of the Services. Except for amounts provided by you
        through the Application as part of the “tip” feature, SYR does not designate any portion of your
        payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third-Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you
        are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third-Party Provider who provides you
        with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. There
        also may be certain Charges you incur that will be owed and paid directly to SYR or its affiliates.
        For the avoidance of doubt, SYR does not charge a fee for a user to access the SYR Marketplace
        Platform but retains the right to charge users a fee or any other Charge for accessing Services made
        available through the Marketplace Platform. Even if not indicated on the SYR Marketplace
        Platform, you understand that the prices for product or menu items displayed through the Services
        may differ from the prices offered or published by Third Party Providers for the same product or
        menu items and/or from prices available at other third-party websites/mobile applications. Prices
        for product or menu items displayed through the Services may not be the lowest prices at which
        the product or menu items are sold.
        If you think a correction should be made to any Charge you incurred, you must let SYR know in
        writing within 30 days after the Charge took place or SYR will have no further responsibility and
        you waive your right to later dispute the amounts charged.

        ### (g) Damage, Cleaning, Lost and Found, and Violation of Terms.
        SYR may charge you a fee if, during your use of the Services, you have caused damage to a
        property that requires repair or cleaning (“Repair” or “Cleaning”). The amount of such fee shall
        be determined, in SYR’s sole discretion, based on the type of damage and the severity. SYR
        reserves the right to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing a
        fee. In the event that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by SYR in SYR's reasonable
        discretion, SYR reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or
        Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts, as well as those
        pertaining to lost and found goods, will be transferred by SYR to a Third-Party Provider, if
        applicable, and are non-refundable.
        Additionally, if you fail to comply with these Terms you may be responsible for Charges, including
        without limitation, for transactions that could not be completed properly, arising out of or in
        connection with your failure to comply with these Terms.
        ## 6. Disclaimers: Limitation of Liability; Indemnity.

        ### (a) Disclaimer.
        THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE." SYR DISCLAIMS ALL
        REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, NOT
        EXPRESSLY SET OUT IN THESE TERMS, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
        MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN ADDITION, SYR MAKES NO REPRESENTATION, WARRANTY, OR
        GUARANTEE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY, TIMELINESS, QUALITY, SUITABILITY,
        OR AVAILABILITY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED
        THROUGH THE USE OF THE SERVICES, OR THAT THE SERVICES WILL BE
        UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
        SYR DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, SAFETY OR ABILITY OF
        THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS. YOU AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF
        YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND ANY SERVICE OR GOOD REQUESTED IN
        CONNECTION THEREWITH, REMAINS SOLELY WITH YOU, TO THE MAXIMUM
        EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.
        SYR DOES NOT CONTROL, MANAGE OR DIRECT ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS
        INCLUDING DRIVERS. THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS ARE NOT ACTUAL AGENTS,
        APPARENT AGENTS, OSTENSIBLE AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES OF SYR.
        SYR DOES NOT CONTROL, ENDORSE OR TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY USER
        CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT AVAILABLE ON OR LINKED TO BY THE
        SERVICES. SYR CANNOT AND DOES NOT REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT THE
        SERVICES OR SERVERS ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.

        ### (b) Limitation of Liability.
        SYR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY,
        PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST PROFITS, LOST
        DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO, IN CONNECTION
        WITH, OR OTHERWISE RESULTING FROM ANY USE OF THE SERVICES, REGARDLESS
        OF THE NEGLIGENCE (EITHER ACTIVE, AFFIRMATIVE, SOLE, OR CONCURRENT) OF
        SYR, EVEN IF SYR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
        SYR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING
        OUT OF (i) YOUR USE OF OR RELIANCE ON THE SERVICES OR YOUR INABILITY TO
        ACCESS OR USE THE SERVICES; OR (ii) ANY TRANSACTION OR RELATIONSHIP
        BETWEEN YOU AND ANY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDER, EVEN IF SYR HAS BEEN
        ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. SYR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
        FOR DELAY OR FAILURE IN PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM CAUSES BEYOND
        SYR'S REASONABLE CONTROL. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIRD-PARTY
        PROVIDERS PROVIDING TRANSPORTATION SERVICES REQUESTED THROUGH
        SOME SYR SERVICES MAY OFFER RIDESHARING OR PEER-TO-PEER
        TRANSPORTATION SERVICES AND MAY NOT BE PROFESSIONALLY LICENSED OR
        PERMITTED. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS ARE NOT 
        OSTENSIBLE AGENTS, APPARENT AGENTS, ACTUAL AGENTS, OR EMPLOYEES OF
        SYR.
        THE SERVICES MAY BE USED BY YOU TO REQUEST AND SCHEDULE FOOD, DINING,
        ENTERTAINMENT, TRANSPORTATION, GOODS, OR LOGISTICS SERVICES WITH
        THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS, BUT YOU AGREE THAT SYR HAS NO RESPONSIBILITY
        OR LIABILITY TO YOU RELATED TO ANY TRANSPORTATION, GOODS OR LOGISTICS
        SERVICES PROVIDED TO YOU BY THIRD-PARTY PROVIDERS OTHER THAN AS
        EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN THESE TERMS.
        SYR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES, LIABILITY OR LOSSES ARISING
        OUT OF LACK OF OR IMPROPER INSTALLATION OR USE OF CHILD RESTRAINT
        SYSTEMS FOR GUESTS ON RIDES REQUESTED THROUGH THE SERVICES FOR
        WHOM A CHILD RESTRAINT SYSTEM IS LEGALLY REQUIRED.
        THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS IN THIS SECTION DO NOT PURPORT TO LIMIT
        LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE
        EXCLUDED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW. BECAUSE SOME STATES OR JURISDICTIONS
        DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF OR THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR
        CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES, IN SUCH STATES OR JURISDICTIONS,
        SYR’S LIABILITY SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. THIS
        PROVISION SHALL HAVE NO EFFECT ON SYR’S CHOICE OF LAW PROVISION SET
        FORTH BELOW.

        ### (c) Indemnity.
        You agree to indemnify and hold SYR and its affiliates and their officers, directors, employees,
        and agents harmless from and against any and all actions, claims, demands, losses, liabilities, costs,
        damages, and expenses (including attorneys' fees), arising out of or in connection with (i) your
        use of the Services or services or goods obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach
        or violation of any of these Terms; (iii) SYR's use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of
        the rights of any third-party, including Third-party Providers.
        ## 7. Other Provisions

        ### (a) Choice of Law.
        These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
        Delaware, U.S.A., without regard to the choice or conflict of law principles of any jurisdiction,
        except as may be otherwise provided in the Arbitration Agreement in Section 2 above or in
        supplemental terms applicable to your region. This Choice of Law provision applies only to the
        interpretation of these Terms and is not intended to create any other substantive right to nonDelawareans to assert claims under Delaware law or bring claims in Delaware courts whether that
        be by statute, common law, or otherwise. These provisions, and except as otherwise provided in
        Section 2 of these Terms, are only intended to specify the use of Delaware law to interpret these
        Terms, and these provisions shall not be interpreted as generally extending Delaware law to you
        if you do not otherwise reside in Delaware.

        Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to incidents or accidents resulting in
        personal injury (including but not limited to sexual assault or harassment claims) that you allege
        occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether before or after the date you agreed
        to the Terms, shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with the laws of the state in which
        the incident or accident occurred.

        ### (b) Choice of Forum.
        Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the existence, breach,
        termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity thereof, shall be brought exclusively in the
        state and federal courts of Delaware, notwithstanding that other courts may have jurisdiction over
        the parties and subject matter, except as may be otherwise provided by the Arbitration Agreement
        above or in supplemental terms applicable to your region.
        Notwithstanding the foregoing, any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to
        incidents or accidents resulting in personal injury (including but not limited to sexual assault or
        harassment claims) that you allege occurred in connection with your use of the Services, whether
        before or after the date you agreed to the Terms, shall be brought exclusively in the state and
        federal courts in the State in which the incident or accident occurred, notwithstanding that other
        courts may have jurisdiction over the parties and subject matter, and except as may be otherwise
        provided in the Arbitration Agreement above or in supplemental terms applicable to your region,
        to the extent permitted by law.
        The foregoing Choice of Law and Choice of Forum provisions do not apply to the Arbitration
        Agreement in Section 2, and we refer you to Section 2 for the applicable provisions for such
        disputes.

        ### (c) Claims of Copyright Infringement.
        Claims of copyright infringement should be sent to SYR's designated agent. SYR will process and
        investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital
        Millennium Copyright Act (“DMCA”) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect
        to any alleged or actual infringement. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be
        emailed to SYR's Copyright Agent at legal@SYR.com (Subject line “DMCA Takedown
        Request”).
        ### To be effective, the notification must be in writing and contain the following information:
        1. An electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner
        of the copyright or other intellectual property interest;
        2. A description of the copyrighted work or other intellectual property that you claim has been
        infringed;
        3. A description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the service,
        with enough detail that we may find it on the service;
        4. Your address, telephone number, and email address;
        5. A statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized
        by the copyright or intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law; and
        6. A statement by you, made under penalty of perjury, that the above information in your
        notice is accurate and that you are the copyright or intellectual property owner or authorized
        to act on the copyright or intellectual property owner's behalf.
        ## Counter-Notice:
        If you believe that your User Content that was removed (or to which access was
        disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the
        copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the content in your User Content,
        you may send a written counter-notice containing the following information to the Copyright
        ## Agent:
        1. Your physical or electronic signature;
        2. Identification of the content that has been removed or to which access has been disabled
        and the location at which the content appeared before it was removed or disabled;
        a statement that you have a good faith belief that the content was removed or disabled as a
        result of mistake or a misidentification of the content; and
        3. Your name, address, telephone number, and email address, a statement that you consent to
        the jurisdiction of the federal court located within northern district of Delaware and a
        statement that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification
        of the alleged infringement.
        If a counter-notice is received by the Copyright Agent, SYR will send a copy of the counter-notice
        to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the removed content or
        cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files an action seeking a court
        order against the content provider, member or user, the removed content may be replaced, or access
        to it restored, in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the counter-notice, at our sole
        discretion.
        ## Repeat Infringer Policy:
        In accordance with the DMCA and other applicable law, SYR has
        adopted a policy of terminating, in appropriate circumstances and at SYR's sole discretion, users
        who are deemed to be repeat infringers. SYR may also at its sole discretion limit access to the
        Service and/or terminate the memberships of any users who infringe any intellectual property
        rights of others, whether or not there is any repeat infringement.
        ### (d) Force Majeure.

        SYR shall not be liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside its
        reasonable control, including, but not limited to, acts of God, natural disasters, war, terrorism,
        riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, pandemics, epidemics
        or disease, strikes or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor or materials.
        ### Notice.
        SYR may give notice by means of a general notice on or through the Services, electronic mail to
        the email address associated with your Account, telephone or text message to any phone number
        provided in connection with your account, or by written communication sent by first class mail or
        pre-paid post to any address connected with your Account. Such notice shall be deemed to have
        been given upon the expiration of 48 hours after mailing or posting (if sent by first class mail or
        pre-paid post) or at the time of sending (if sent by email, telephone, or on or through the Services).
        You may give notice to SYR, with such notice deemed given when received by SYR, at any time
        by first class mail or pre-paid post to our registered agent for service of process. The name and
        current contact information for the registered agent in each state are available online at
        https://www.wolterskluwer.com/en/solutions/ct-corporation/sop-locations. If another provision of
        these Terms addresses any specific notice (for example, notice of updates to these Terms, or notice
        of a dispute or arbitration demand), those specific notice provisions shall prevail to the extent there
        is any conflict or inconsistency between those provisions and this notice provision.
        ## General.
        You may not assign these Terms without SYR's prior written approval. SYR may assign these Terms without your consent to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of SYR's equity,
        business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment by you in violation of
        this section shall be void. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists
        between you, SYR or any Third-party Provider as a result of this Agreement or use of the Services.
        If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be
        struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent under law. SYR's failure
        to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or
        provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by SYR in writing. This provision shall not affect
        the Severability and Survivability section of the Arbitration Agreement of these Terms.
